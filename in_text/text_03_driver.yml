  Data to support water quality modeling efforts in the Delaware River Basin: 3) Model Driver Data

abstract: >-
  This data release contains information to support water quality modeling in the Delaware River Basin (DRB).
  These data support both process-based and machine learning approaches to water quality modeling, including
  the prediction of stream temperature.


  This section includes model drivers such as gridded weather data (NOAA GEFS and GridMET), and the stream network distance matrix for the Delaware River Basin.
  Additionally, inputs and outputs from an uncalibrated process-based stream temperature model (PRMS-SNTemp) are included.

        All columns other than the "from" column are named with a seg_id_nat from the Geospatial Fabric for National Hydrologic Modeling.
        The column values correspond to the distance (in meters) between the seg_id_nat in the "from" column to the {seg_id_nat} in the column name.
        Positive numbers indicate a downstream direction, while negative numbers indicate an upstream direction.
        "inf" indicates the two segments are not connected by streamflow (e.g., water from two separate
        branches that share the same mainstem are not connected via streamflow).

    data-name: uncal_sntemp_inputs_outputs.zip
    data-description: >-
      PRMS-SNTemp inputs and outputs,
      including weather driver data, intermediate variables, and
      model predictions. The file contain inputs/outputs from all 456 stream reaches in the
      Delaware River Basin modeling network.

      Code used to generate these inputs and outputs can be found in the repository "run-prms-sntemp" in Zwart and others 2022 (XX - update with new citation).

      There are two error codes in PRMS-SNTemp v5.1.0_rc that can be present in the
      seg_tave_water and seg_tave_upstream attributes indicating no streamflow for the current
      timestep (error code: -98.9) or no streamflow at any timestep (error code: -99.9) of the model run.
      Stream segments that never have streamflow (-99.9) do not have any hydrologic reach units and do not have any upstream segments to produce
      streamflow, and consequently never be able to simulate stream temperature. Segments with
      contributing hydrologic reach units and/or upstream segments can have streamflow but
      may not have streamflow at the current timestep (-98.9)

      Very negative groundwater and shallow subsurface water temperatures (e.g. less than -1 C) are
      not error codes, but rather are a product of the way this version of PRMS-SNTemp is coded. However,
      we advise against using these very low groundwater and shallow subsurface temperature values
      as they likely are far from actual water temperatures.

      Seg_id_nat:3558 was identified as an outlier with output variables inconsistent with physical reality and therefore remove from this final dataset.

      Tabular aggregated version of the GridMET data collected for the DRB contains spatial meterological data from 1979 to 2022, in daily time steps. This data is maintained and collected by the Climatology Lab (https://www.climatologylab.org/gridmet.html).
      The data is aggregated to PRMS river reach scale (from NHM hydrologic response units) through an area-weighted mean, such that each segment evaluated in this study has associated meteorological data at daily time-steps since 01-01-1979.
      The meteorological data variables used in this study include temperature, radiation, wind speed, precipitation, and humidity measurements, derived from GridMET's original 4-square kilometer gridded measurements.
      The aggregated version of this dataset provides model-ready data because it contains one value per reach-day.

    data-name: gridmet_drb_agg_nc.zip
    data-description: >-
      NetCDF format of the GridMET data in tabular format as data described above (gridmet_drb_agg_csv.zip). This data is aggregated through area weighted mean to the HRU polygons of the DRB.
      The spatial version of the GridMET data (with netcdf extension) is used to run the PRMS-SNTemp model.

        Local model hru id. This attribute is a product of the xarray package through the regridding of the meteorological spatial data (raster format) to the spatial polygon input. For this study, the spatial polygon input is the PRMS catchment polygon geopackage . 
        This ID attribute is used to match to the PRMS HRU IDs of catchment geopackage, to 1) run PRMS-SNTemp and to 2) produce the gridmet_drb_agg.csv

process-description: >-
  The modeling framework for process-based flow and temperature prediction is a coupled hydrologic-thermodynamic model that
  uses inputs of reach-specific properties and local meteorology to estimate flow and water temperature.
  Our chosen process-based stream model is the open source, Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) with
  the coupled Stream Network Temperature Model (SNTemp) version 5.1.0 RC (Markstron, 2012; Regan et al. 2017).
  PRMS is a deterministic model that simulates watershed hydrology as a function of climate and land use,
  and the coupled SNTemp module simulates the change in stream temperature as a function of changes in hydrology
  and energy.
