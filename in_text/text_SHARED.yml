process-description: >-
  Uncalibrated process model predictions of river water temperature were generated with a coupled hydrologic-thermodynamic model that uses inputs of reach-specific properties and local meteorology to estimate flow and water temperature.
  Our chosen process-based stream model is the open source, Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) with the coupled Stream Network Temperature Model (SNTemp) version 5.1.0 RC. PRMS is a
  deterministic model that simulates watershed hydrology as a function of climate and land use, and the coupled SNTemp module simulates the change in stream temperature as a function of
  changes in hydrology and energy.
