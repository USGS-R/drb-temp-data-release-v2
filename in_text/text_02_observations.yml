  Data to support water quality modeling efforts in the Delaware River Basin: 2) Observations

abstract: >-
  <p>This section contains observations related to the amount and quality of water in the Delaware River Basin.
  Data from a subset of reservoirs in the basin include observed daily depth-resolved water temperature,
  water levels, diversions, and releases. Data from streams in the basin include daily flow and temperature
  observations. Observations were compiled from a variety of sources,
  including the National Water Inventory System, Water Quality Portal, EcoSHEDS stream water temperature
  database, and the New York Department of Environmental Protection.
  The data are formatted as a single csv (comma separated values) or zipped csv.


  <p>For modeling purposes, we created a holdout test set of flow and temperature observations that were
  representative of dynamics throughout the Delaware River basin from water year 1980-present. Test holdouts
  are documented in the flow and temperature files, and details describing the holdout decisions
  can be found in Oliver et al. (2021).

    data-name: unaggregated_temperature_observations_drb.zip
      Daily water temperature observations with sites matched to model river segments in the Delaware River Basin.
      Files represent various subsets of similar data, and are either sites matched to any of the 456 segments (temperature_observations_drb.zip),
      sites matched to a subset of 56 river segments above the
      Delaware River at Lordville, NY (temperature_observations_lordville.zip), or at the 5 priority forecast sites.
      Water temperature observations were compiled from NWIS, EcoSHEDS, and WQP. If multiple sites were matched to a single
      river reach and had measurements on the same day, the values were averaged.

      Temperature observations for five priority forecasting sites in the Delaware River Basin
      were first pulled from NWIS, and remaining data gaps in the modeling period
      were filled if there was data available from other sources (WQP or EcoSHEDS).

      attr-def:  >-
        An alternative unique reach identifier which was created in order to split segments such that
        segment start and endpoints were connected by one reach with no intersecting reaches. The ID was created
        using the seg_id from the Geospatial Fabric and an index from one to the number of splits (e.g., {subseg_id}_{index}).

        The closest river reach from the Geospatial Fabric v1.1, by Euclidean distance, from the monitoring site.
        Matches were limited to a 500m buffer of the monitoring site. The reach number is from the field "nsegment_v1_1" in the
        Geospatial Fabric for the National Hydrologic Model v1.1.


        Once the original reach match was assigned, the matched segment was reassigned if the endpoint of the
        upstream reach was closer to the monitoring site (by river distance) than the endpoint of the matched reach.
        If the upstream endpoint was closer, but there was a confluence directly upstream, then the original match was kept.
