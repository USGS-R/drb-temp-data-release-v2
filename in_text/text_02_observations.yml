  Data to support water quality modeling efforts in the Delaware River Basin: 2) River and Reservoir Observations

abstract: >-
  This data release contains information to support water quality modeling in the Delaware River Basin (DRB).
  These data support both process-based and machine learning approaches to water quality modeling, including
  the prediction of stream temperature.


  This section contains observations related to the amount and quality of water in the Delaware River Basin.
  Data from a subset of reservoirs in the basin include observed daily depth-resolved water temperature,
  water levels, diversions, and releases. Data from streams in the basin include daily flow and temperature
  observations. Observations were compiled from a variety of sources,
  including the National Water Inventory System, Water Quality Portal, EcoSHEDS stream water temperature
  database, and the New York Department of Environmental Protection.
  The data are formatted as a single csv (comma separated values) or zipped csv.


  Site observation data was matched to stream reach segments, and the data files included contain identifiers for
  both observation sites and affiliated stream reaches. Please see metadata for <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/623e54c4d34e915b67d83580"> 1) Spatial data for rivers, reservoirs, and monitoring
  locations </a> for further information on how monitoring location sites were matched to river segments.</li>


  For modeling purposes, we created a holdout test set of flow and temperature observations that were
  representative of dynamics throughout the Delaware River basin from water year 1980-present. Test holdouts
  are documented in the flow and temperature files, and details describing the holdout decisions
  can be found in Oliver et al. (2021).

    data-name: unaggregated_temperature_observations_drb.zip
    data-description: >-
      Daily water temperature observations reported at measurement sites and matched to model river segments in the Delaware River Basin.
      Observation data are from the National Water Information System, EcoSHEDS, and the Water Quality Portal. Observations
      were matched to the closest stream segments in the Geospatial Fabric and manually inspected. These data are unaggragated at
      the reach scale, meaning that there may be multiple observations per seg_id_nat-day. This indicates there
      were multiple sites along a single reach, or multiple sensors deployed at a single site.

      Reported values are daily statistics that are often, but not always, derived from multiple sub-daily measurements.
      In some cases, it is difficult to know whether the reported values actually represent multiple sub-daily measurements
      because the data came aggregated. In this file, observations where the minimum and maximum value are equal likely
      represent discrete measurements of water temperature. Additionally, observations with a time stamp represent discrete
      values from the Water Quality Portal.

    data-description: >-
      Daily water temperature observations with sites matched to model river segments in the Delaware River Basin.
      This file is the reach-aggregated version of unaggregated_temperature_observations_drb.zip,
      where there is only a single water temperature observation reported per reach-day.

      Multiple reach-day values in unaggregated_temperature_observations_drb.zip indicates either multiple
      monitoring locations along a single reach or multiple sensors deployed at the same site. To aggregate to
      a single value per reach-day, we first prioritized data coming from NWIS. That is, prior to taking the mean value
      for a reach-day, we retained only data from NWIS (source = nwis_dv or nwis_uv). To aggregate multiple mean temperatures, we took
      the mean of all values and also report a standard deviation of those values. To aggregate multiple minimum and maximum temperature,
      we report the minimum and maximum of all values, respectively.

    data-description: >-
      Daily reservoir diversions from Pepacton and Cannonsville Reservoirs.
      Data were previously published by the U.S. Geological Survey and we extracted
      and combined data from annual water-data reports for New York.

        Type of data - observed daily value (observed daily) or interpolated daily value from monthly data (interpolated daily).
        The monthly data were reported as average diversion per day, and for interpolation, we assumed a constant value over the whole month.

process-description: >-
  Stream and reservoir observations were combined from multiple sources to achieve the most complete temporal coverage possible
  from 1980-2022. For reservoir water budget data (water levels, diversions), we interpolated monthly data
  or between daily observerations to achieve complete temporal coverage. For temperature and flow observations,
  the intended modeling framework requires the data to be reduced to a single observation
  per waterbody per day. For reservoirs, this means that if multiple sites were monitored per reservoir-day,
  the data were collapsed to a single value. For reservoir temperature data, this was done by taking the
  observations from the site closest to the dam, or if that site was not monitored on a given day, an average of all other sites.
  For streams, flow and temperature data were reduced to one value per reach-day for each of the 456 stream reaches defined in this
  data release. We have also included the spatially unaggregated stream temperature data in this release.
