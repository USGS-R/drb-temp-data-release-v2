  Data to support water quality modeling efforts in the Delaware River Basin: 1) Spatial data for rivers, reservoirs, and monitoring locations

abstract: >-

  This section provides spatial data files that describe the rivers, reservoirs, and observational
  data in the Delaware River Basin included in this release. One shapefile of polylines
  describes the 456 river reaches that define the modeling network, and another shapefile of polygons includes
  the three reservoirs (Pepacton, Cannonsville, and Neversink) for which data are included in this release. Additionally, a point shapefile
  contains locations of monitoring sites along the reaches with supporting attributes that describe
  the monitoring location.

      attr-label: subsegid
      attr-def: >-
        An alternative unique reach identifier which was created in order to split segments such that
        segment start and endpoints were connected by one reach with no intersecting reaches. The ID was created
        using the seg_id from the Geospatial Fabric and an index from one to the number of splits (e.g., {subseg_id}_{index}).
        This feature corresponds to subseg_id in other files.

      GIS point data for flow and temperature monitoring sites in the Delaware River Basin.
      
      Sites represent all sites within the Delaware River Basin boundary that were retrieved from
      EcoSHEDS, Water Quality Portal, or the National Water Information System and matched to the
      stream network included in study_stream_reaches.zip. Sites were limited to those
      that matched to our stream network and that met our distance critera (fish distance < 20,000 m and bird distance < 250 m).

      Sites were matched to the closest river reach from the Geospatial Fabric v1.1, by Euclidean distance,
      from the monitoring site latitude and longitude.
      Sites represent all sites within the Delaware River Basin boundary that were retrieved from
      EcoSHEDS, Water Quality Portal, or the National Water Information System. Sites were limited to those
      that matched to our stream network and that met our distance critera (fish distance < 20,000 m and bird distance < 250 m).
      Once the original reach match was assigned, the matched segment was reassigned if the endpoint of the
      upstream reach was closer to the monitoring site (by river distance) than the endpoint of the matched reach.
      If the upstream endpoint was closer, but there was a confluence directly upstream, then the original match
      was kept. Manual inspection of the site-to-reach matches indicated monitoring sites were located on
      tributaries that are not represented in the Geospatial Fabric; these sites were removed from both the
      site metadata and observation data.
