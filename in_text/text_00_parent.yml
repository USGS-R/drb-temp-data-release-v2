  Data release to support multiple modeling efforts in the Delaware River Basin

abstract: >-
  <p> This data release contains spatial, observational, and driver data used as inputs for multiple modeling efforts in the Delaware River Basin (DRB).  
  The data  in this release primarily supports the 7-day ahead maximum water temperature forecasting models that output real-time predictions in the DRB for 2022 (<li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/6238fcead34e915b67cc4856"> Data to support network-wide 7-day ahead forecasting of water temperature in teh Delware River Basin  </a>).
  The model is driven by weather forecasts and observed reservoir releases and produces maximum water temperature forecasts for the issue day (day 0) and 7 days into the future (days 1-7) at five sites. This data release captures the entire forecasting period that is reported in Zwart et al. 2022 and is an extension of XX.
  The data is stored in 3 child folders: 1_spatial folder, 2_observations and 3_driver data folder.

  One shapefile of polylines for the 456 river segments in this study, a reservoir polygon metadata file, and one shapefile of reservoir polygons for the Pepacton, Cannonsville, and Neversink reservoirs.
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/623e550ad34e915b67d8366e"> 2_observations </a> - Observations data ((e.g. temperatures measurements, flow observations) used for modeling efforts for designated time frame in the Delaware River Basin</li> - 
  Water temperature and streamflow observations for river reaches used in this study, raw and aggregated. Reservoir observations such as water temperature, water level, and release observations for the Pepacton, Cannonsville, and Neversink reservoirs reservoirs.
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/623e5587d34e915b67d83806"> 3_driver </a> - Driver data (e.g. weather, ) used for modeling efforts for designated time frame in the Delaware River Basin </li>
  <br/> Data used to drive predictive models (distance matrices, river reach metadata, daily meteorology for river reaches and reservoirs, observed reservoir diversions and releases).
  This child item also includes PRMS-SNTemp predictions of water temperature for inflow and outflow reaches of the Pepacton and Cannonsville reservoirs, GLM 3.1 predictions of ourflow and water temperature for reservoir outflow reaches,
  GLM 3.1 predictions of in-reservoir water temperatures at the depth of reservoir outlets, stream temperature predictions from the distance-weighted-average lotic-lentic input network, and 7-day ahead deep learning water temperature forecasts at 5 priority sites.
