  Data to support water quality modeling efforts in the Delaware River Basin

abstract: >-
  <p> This data release contains information to support water quality modeling in the Delaware River Basin (DRB).
  These data support both process-based and machine learning approaches to water quality modeling, including
  the prediction of stream temperature. Reservoirs in the DRB serve an important role as a source of drinking
  water, but also affect downstream water quality. Therefore, this data release includes data that
  characterize both rivers and a subset of reservoirs in the basin. This release provides an update
  to many of the files provided in a previous data release (Oliver et al., 2021).


  <p> The data are stored in 3 child folders: 1) spatial information, 2) observations, and 3) model driver data.</p>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/623e54c4d34e915b67d83580"> 1) Spatial Information </a>- Spatial data used for modeling efforts in the Delaware River Basin</li> -
  a shapefile of polylines for the 456 river segments, point data for observation locations, and polygons for the three (Pepacton, Cannonsville, and Neversink) reservoirs in this dataset.
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/623e550ad34e915b67d8366e"> 2) Observations </a>- Reservoir (surface levels, releases, diversions, water temperature) and river (water temperature and flow)
  observations that can be used to train and test water quality models. </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/623e5587d34e915b67d83806"> 3) Model driver data </a>- Driver data used to force water quality models, including
  stream reach distance matrices and daily meteorology data from <li><a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/global-ensemble-forecast">NOAA GEFS</a></li> and <li><a href="https://www.climatologylab.org/gridmet.html">gridMET</a></li>. This child item also
  includes the inputs and outputs of an uncalibrated run of PRMS-SNTemp which predicts mean water temperature
  at all 456 reaches in the DRB.


  <p> This data compilation was funded by the USGS.
