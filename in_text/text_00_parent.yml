  Data release to support multiple modeling efforts in the Delaware River Basin

abstract: >-
  <p> This data release contains spatial, observational, and driver data used as inputs for multiple modeling efforts in the Delaware River Basin (DRB).  
  The data provided in this release primarily supports the 7-day ahead maximum water temperature forecasting model that produces real-time predictions in the DRB for 2022 (<li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/6238fcead34e915b67cc4856"> Data to support network-wide 7-day ahead forecasting of water temperature in teh Delware River Basin  </a>).
  The data is stored in 3 child folders: 1_spatial folder, 2_observations and 3_driver data folder.
